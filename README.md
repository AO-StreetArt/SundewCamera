# Sundew Camera

Sundew is a prototype IoT device that performs onboard computer vision tasks and provides flexible input and output channels.  User output is handled via headphones in order to support vision-impaired users.  The prototype device will run on a Raspberry Pi 5 with an AI Hat.

The overall purpose of the project is to evaluate the usage of new AI-enabled IoT chips and SoC/SoM vendors (specifically, in this case, Hailo.ai).
