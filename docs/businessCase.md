# Sundew Business Case

Vision-impaired users stand to benefit greatly from advances in computer vision if they can be offered in cheap, affordable devices.  These benefits are wide ranging, but include:

* Listing the known objects in a given view with object detection
* Incorporating segmentation & depth estimation could eventually give us velocity tracking, which lets us do things like warn when something is coming toward them (ie. about to get hit by a car or walk into a wall)

Fundamentally, we want to provide an onboard assistant that can be the eyes of someone who cannot see.  While this lofty goal is not something that can be accomplished to fully equal a human yet, the benefits we can offer are more than worth a few hundred dollars.
